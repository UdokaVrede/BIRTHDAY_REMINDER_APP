This project is open to all contributors, you ideas are also welcomed.

## HOW DO I CONTRIBUTE TO A PROJECT?

- If this is your first contribution,You start with little fixes.
- Discuss the changes you wish to make by creating an [issue](https://github.com/EddieJaoudeCommunity/EddieJaoudeCommunity.github.io/issues/new), comment on an already created issue, or contact us via our [discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/jZQs6Wu).
- Once you have been assigned the issue by the maintainer, you can go ahead to fork the repo, clone and make changes to fix the issue. For steps on how to do this, [this here](https://udoka.hashnode.dev/a-beginners-guide-to-open-source-contribution) is a helpful guide.

## MAKING YOUR PULL REQUEST

When you are done with your changes, and you have checked the new changes you made, you can create a pull request referencing the number of the issue you fixed in the description as seen here:
```
This PR fixes issue # "issue number"
```

Once, you have completed this, your pull request would be reviewed by a maintainer, if it satisfies the requirements of the corresponding issue to which it was made, it would be merged.

Kudos to you :balloon:
